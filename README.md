#### Personal Neural Network Library

This library serves as a personal learning resource for understanding neural networks and the algorithms and math behind them. The main purpose of this project is self-education and it doesn't serve any specific application beyond my own learning goals.

#### Features

- Implementation of a feedforward neural network
- Input layer and Dense layer
- Various activation functions
- Various loss functions
- Various optimization algorithms
- Various weight initialization techniques

(check documentation to see the full list of implemented activation functions, loss functions etc.)

#### Technologies used

- Python 3.10.12
- Numpy 1.23.5
- Pandas 2.12.0 (used in some examples to manipulate the input data)

#### Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MortenTsinakov/n2rv.git
