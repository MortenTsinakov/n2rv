#### Personal Neural Network Library

This library serves as a personal learning resource for understanding neural networks and the algorithms and math behind them. The main purpose of this project is self-education and it doesn't serve any specific application beyond my own learning goals.

#### Features

- Implementation of a feedforward neural network
- Input layer and Dense layer
- Various activation functions
- Mean Squared Error and Categorical Cross-Entropy loss functions
- Various optimization algorithms
- Various weight initialization techniques

#### Installation

Clone the repository like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/MortenTsinakov/nn_library_lesson.git
```

#### Usage

Please check the documentation for examples demonstrating how to use the library
